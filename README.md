# Denver Post replica

This is a replica of the Denver Post website, built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The libraries used are [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) (for structure and handy classes) and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.com/) (for icons).

It has been created as a university assignment for the course **B028451 (B047) - PROGETTAZIONE E PRODUZIONE MULTIMEDIALE** of the University of Florence.

All its content is fictional, only the structure and the layout have been replicated.
